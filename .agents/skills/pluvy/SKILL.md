name: pluvy
description: Run the pluvy gate after code tasks only in repositories with a project policy or an explicit project requirement, or when the user explicitly requests a run. Use also to adopt, install, configure or explain pluvy, edit `.pluvy/pluvy.json`, triage findings, inspect checker coverage and options, or use approved line suppression with a reason in every supported language. A global installation or skill availability alone does not enable a repository; without adoption or an explicit run request, skip the run and the gate notice.

# pluvy

pluvy is a parse-based architecture policy gate: it audits this repository's
sources against the policy in `.pluvy/pluvy.json` and reports findings.

## Decide whether the gate applies

Check the target repository (the explicit `--root`, or the repository being
worked on). The gate applies when at least one is true:

- The repository has `.pluvy/pluvy.json`.
- Project instructions, scripts or CI explicitly require the gate, including a
  policy selected through `--config`; use that project's root and config path.
- The user explicitly requests a gate run for this task.

If none applies, stop silently: do not run the gate, create a policy, suggest
setup, or include a skipped, missing-config or "not counted as passed" gate
notice in the task report; continue the project's own checks. A globally
installed executable, a discoverable skill, an example policy or a skill
pointer alone does not enable the gate, and the CLI must not be run just to
test adoption.

Non-adoption is silent; failure is not. When the gate applies, missing
configuration is a failure, and an invalid or unreadable policy is a failure:
keep the CLI's exit-code semantics and never skip silently.

This skill also covers adoption, installation, configuration, explanation and
triage when requested, even before adoption; loading it for those purposes
neither requires a gate run nor authorizes creating a project policy.

## Gate policy (binding)

1. `After completing a code task in a repository where the gate applies, run the pluvy gate before reporting the task done, and report the mode, exit code and findings truthfully.`
2. `When the gate applies, never claim it passed when it was not run, failed with exit code 2, or the tool is not installed; state the reason explicitly instead. When it does not apply, omit gate execution and reporting.`
3. `Do not add suppressions or weaken the policy to make the gate appear green; policy changes require a separate full audit and review.`

## Post-task gate commands

| Situation | Command | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Task changes are uncommitted | `pluvy --base HEAD` | Working tree vs HEAD, untracked included (new files get a full audit) |
| The task produced commits | `pluvy --base <task start commit>` (the parent of the task's first commit) | On a clean tree `--base HEAD` audits 0 files and exits 0 — a false pass to avoid |
| Task start commit unknown | `pluvy --all`, and state that this is a full audit that may include pre-existing debt | Prefer over-reporting to under-reporting |
| `--staged` | Not used for post-task gating | Reads index blobs only, which does not match the agent workflow boundary |

Canonical commands:

```sh
pluvy --all
pluvy --staged
pluvy --base <commit>
pluvy --root /path/to/project --all
pluvy --all --format json
```

`--root` defaults to the current directory (Git modes require the repository
root); `--config` defaults to `.pluvy/pluvy.json`, resolved relative to the
root.

## Exit codes

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | No error-severity findings (warnings do not affect it) |
| `1` | Error-severity findings are present |
| `2` | Configuration/encoding/filesystem/Git failure (including `--staged` while a policy change is staged) |

## Post-run checks

1. The gate output ends with a line like `Architecture base: N files; M findings.`.
   If N is 0 while the task really changed code, the base choice is wrong:
   reselect it and rerun; do not treat the run as a pass.
2. If the task changed the policy file, judge it with a separate `pluvy --all`,
   not a `--base` run alone, and have the policy change reviewed.
3. Unrelated dirty changes that predate the task are swept into `--base HEAD`
   runs: list them truthfully; do not filter them silently.

## Report format

Applies only when the gate applies. Report the mode, the exit code and the
findings (error/warning counts plus key items). If an applicable gate was not
run, exited with code 2, or the tool is not installed, state that explicitly —
never report the task as gated or passed. Where the gate does not apply, omit
gate status entirely. Test-suite execution and its reporting stay independent
of gate applicability.

## Triage

1. Fix the code first: findings are evidence of policy violations.
2. A standalone next-line suppression comment naming the exact rule id is
   allowed, in every supported language, only for an exception explicitly
   approved by a human beforehand; the written reason only records that
   approval. Use the language's own line-comment marker: `#` in Python, `//`
   in Go, Java and the JavaScript family. Block-comment forms, wildcards,
   lists, `type.suppression` itself and a missing reason are invalid and
   report `type.suppression`. Syntax and validation rules:
   [approved next-line diagnostic exceptions](references/comment-suppressions.md).
3. Policy changes (thresholds, excludes, owners, boundaries, enable flags) are
   architecture decisions: they require a separate `--all` full audit and
   review. Never weaken the policy to force a green report (policy item 3).

## Capability boundaries and language support

The gate parses the selected sources with tree-sitter, collects syntactic
evidence and applies the policy. What it does not do:

- It does not infer types: broad markers, annotations and conversions are
  syntactic evidence, not resolved types or compiler proofs.
- It does not resolve package aliases, build-system aliases, dynamic imports,
  reflection or computed members, and it does not prove runtime ownership or
  which implementation a call reaches.
- It does not detect all unused code, prove validators or logging safety, or
  measure coverage; unused findings describe the checked snapshot view and
  unresolved external usage, not a repository-wide proof.
- It is not a linter, formatter, type checker or coverage tool: keep the
  language formatter, type checker, tests, branch coverage and semantic
  architecture review as separate required checks.
- JavaScript and JSX carry no type annotations: type safety needs a configured
  type-aware checker, while usage, boundary and encoding analysis still run on
  those files.
- A passing syntax gate does not certify compliance with every policy rule.

Six analyzers cover seven languages:

| Analyzer | Source suffixes |
|---|---|
| Python | `.py`, `.pyi` |
| Go | `.go` |
| Java | `.java` |
| JavaScript and JSX | `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs` |
| TypeScript | `.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts` |
| TSX | `.tsx` |

Selection and enablement:

- Every checker is enabled by default for every selected file; `enabled: false`
  turns one checker off for all selected files, and there is no `enabled` flag
  scoped to one language or one file.
- The global `include` and `exclude` lists drop files from every checker at
  once, except that changed snapshot paths reported by the run-level
  `test.deletion` gate follow the changed set instead
  ([its checker page](references/checkers/test.deletion.md)).
- Architecture `placements`, `boundaries` and `paths` (under
  `architecture.object_model`) only select where that one architecture check
  applies.
- `owners` is not a file selector: once owners are configured and the checker
  is enabled, every selected file must match exactly one owner, so an unmatched
  or doubly matched file is a finding.

Coverage does not promise complete evidence for every construct: resolution
limits for boundaries, usage, encodings and guarded projections are recorded on
the corresponding checker pages and remain review obligations.

## Checkers and per-language coverage

The schema has 22 logical checkers, which produce 29 built-in diagnostic IDs.
`function_size` owns the five `size.*` IDs, `test.integrity` owns
`test.tautology` and `test.vacuous`, `flow.handling` owns `flow.swallow` and
`flow.fallback`, and `type.contract` owns `type.nullable` and `type.union`;
the run-level `test.deletion` owns its single diagnostic outside analyzer
registration, and every other checker name matches its diagnostic ID.

| Checker | Reports | Languages |
|---|---|---|
| [`structure.guarded_projection`](references/checkers/structure.guarded_projection.md) | Repeated guarded field copies in one local region (three distinct destination fields by default) | All |
| [`function_size`](references/checkers/function_size.md) | Function lines, statements, complexity, nesting and parameters; one switch for five diagnostics | All |
| [`test.integrity`](references/checkers/test.integrity.md) | Tautological assertions and tests without a meaningful assertion; one switch for two diagnostics | All |
| [`test.deletion`](references/checkers/test.deletion.md) | Removed test files, assertion erosion and changed snapshot paths in changed audits; one run-level diagnostic with error and warning forms | All; run-level |
| [`flow.handling`](references/checkers/flow.handling.md) | Swallowed exception handlers and long `??` chains whose defaults are all bare literals; one switch for two diagnostics | Python, Java, JavaScript, JSX, TypeScript, TSX |
| [`type.contract`](references/checkers/type.contract.md) | Aggregated nullable declarations, bare nullish fallbacks and oversized unions; one switch for two diagnostics | TypeScript, TSX |
| [`type.annotation`](references/checkers/type.annotation.md) | Broad or bare Python annotations and invalid forward annotations | Python |
| [`type.signature`](references/checkers/type.signature.md) | Missing Python parameter and return annotations | Python |
| [`type.broad`](references/checkers/type.broad.md) | Recognized broad type markers and JSON serialization outside proven outputs and permitted library inputs | All; markers differ per language |
| [`type.boundary`](references/checkers/type.boundary.md) | Recognized library results and callback inputs used without typed conversion | All |
| [`unused.parameter`](references/checkers/unused.parameter.md) | Parameters without resolved read usage | All |
| [`unused.function`](references/checkers/unused.function.md) | Non-exported functions and methods without resolved references | All |
| [`unused.field`](references/checkers/unused.field.md) | Fields without reads; initialization and writes alone do not count | All |
| [`unused.return`](references/checkers/unused.return.md) | Known non-void results discarded at a call site; always a warning | All |
| [`type.assertion`](references/checkers/type.assertion.md) | Unchecked casts and assertions | Python, Java, TypeScript, TSX |
| [`type.suppression`](references/checkers/type.suppression.md) | Foreign suppression directives and malformed or unused next-line exceptions | All |
| [`imports.wildcard`](references/checkers/imports.wildcard.md) | Python wildcard imports | Python |
| [`architecture.owner`](references/checkers/architecture.owner.md) | Missing or overlapping responsibility owners | All |
| [`architecture.structure`](references/checkers/architecture.structure.md) | Selected modules outside their configured owning locations | All |
| [`architecture.import`](references/checkers/architecture.import.md) | Dependencies forbidden by configured boundaries | All |
| [`architecture.dispatch`](references/checkers/architecture.dispatch.md) | Language and rule identity comparison or match/switch dispatch | All |
| [`architecture.object_model`](references/checkers/architecture.object_model.md) | Non-underscore module-level functions in configured extension paths; Go reports unexported lowercase package-level functions too, receiver methods and Java are not reported | Python, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, TSX |

Every analyzer registers the same base set of 19 diagnostic IDs:
`unused.parameter`, `unused.function`, `unused.field`, `unused.return`,
`type.boundary`, `type.suppression`, `size.lines`, `size.statements`,
`size.complexity`, `size.nesting`, `size.parameters`, `architecture.owner`,
`architecture.structure`, `architecture.import`, `architecture.dispatch`,
`architecture.object_model`, `structure.guarded_projection`, `test.tautology`
and `test.vacuous`. `test.deletion` is not part of that set: no analyzer
registers it, and it is produced by the run-level deletion gate only in
`--base` and `--staged` mode.

The remaining nine diagnostic IDs are registered per language, and a registered
diagnostic can only report for the analyzer that registered it:

| Analyzer | Additional diagnostic IDs |
|---|---|
| Python | `type.annotation`, `type.signature`, `type.assertion`, `type.broad`, `imports.wildcard`, `flow.swallow` |
| Go | `type.broad` |
| Java | `type.assertion`, `type.broad`, `flow.swallow` |
| JavaScript and JSX | `type.broad`, `flow.swallow`, `flow.fallback` |
| TypeScript and TSX | `type.assertion`, `type.broad`, `type.nullable`, `type.union`, `flow.swallow`, `flow.fallback` |

Key differences:

- `type.annotation`, `type.signature` and `imports.wildcard` appear in Python
  files only.
- `type.assertion` covers Python, Java, TypeScript and TSX, but not Go or
  JavaScript.
- `type.nullable` and `type.union` appear in TypeScript and TSX files only.
- `flow.swallow` covers Python, Java and the JavaScript family; `flow.fallback`
  appears in JavaScript, JSX, TypeScript and TSX files only.
- `unused.return` is always a warning, snapshot-only `test.vacuous` findings are
  warnings, and `test.deletion` reports a changed snapshot path as a warning;
  every other diagnostic reports errors. Warnings never change the exit code.
- `architecture.object_model` is registered by every analyzer, but only
  grammars with module-level functions can report. Go is included: a
  package-level function whose name does not start with `_` is reported, so an
  unexported `func check(...)` is a finding — the test is the leading underscore,
  not export status. Go receiver methods and Java files produce no findings.
- `type.broad` markers differ per language: `typing.Any`,
  `typing_extensions.Any` and `pydantic.JsonValue` references plus internal
  `json.dumps` results in Python; `any`, empty interfaces and imported
  `encoding/json` results in Go; `java.lang.Object`, unbounded wildcards and
  recognized raw collections plus Gson/Jackson results in Java; `JSON.stringify`
  results in JavaScript and JSX; `any`, `unknown`, `object` and empty object
  types plus `JSON.stringify` results in TypeScript and TSX.
- One Python annotation can report twice: `typing.Any` triggers both
  `type.annotation` and `type.broad`.

Full detail for every checker — role, language differences, options, defaults,
types and correct/incorrect configuration — is on its own page linked from the
[checker index](references/checkers.md).

## Checker configuration

Each repository commits its policy at `.pluvy/pluvy.json`; the gate never
changes it. The policy separates global file selection from checker options:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "include": ["src/*", "tests/*"],
  "exclude": [],
  "third_party_modules": [],
  "checkers": {
    "function_size": {"lines": 40},
    "architecture.owner": {
      "owners": [{"name": "domain", "paths": ["src/domain/*"]}]
    }
  }
}
```

Rules that apply to every checker:

- `enabled` is a strict boolean, defaulting to `true`. JSON `true` or `false`
  only: `"false"`, `0` and `null` are errors. Omit `enabled: true` and entries
  that only repeat defaults.
- Unknown checker IDs and unknown options are errors, including when the
  checker is disabled. The same rejection applies inside nested option objects.
- `function_size` is one checker with one switch owning the five `size.*`
  diagnostics; suppression comments name those diagnostic IDs, not the checker
  key.
- `include` and `exclude` are the only global file selectors and must stay at
  the top level.
- `third_party_modules` is a top-level list of exact import specifiers. It
  grants a directional library-input exception for erased dictionaries, not a
  file or checker exemption.
- `type.broad.encoding` holds four lists, all empty by default: `encoders`,
  `decoders`, `outputs` and `instance_outputs`. They extend built-in
  serialization recognition; they never exempt broad annotations, casts or
  incoming library results.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "third_party_modules": ["vendor.client"],
  "checkers": {
    "structure.guarded_projection": {"min_fields": 4},
    "type.broad": {
      "encoding": {
        "encoders": ["vendor.client.encode"],
        "outputs": [{"call": "vendor.client.publish", "arguments": [0]}]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

An invalid policy, rejected before any file is checked:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "checkers": {
    "function_size": {"enabled": "false"},
    "type.broad": {"maximum": 3},
    "syntax.invalid": {"enabled": false}
  }
}
```

The string flag fails the strict boolean, `maximum` is not a `type.broad`
option, and `syntax.invalid` is not a checker. Malformed configuration fails
closed with exit code 2.

Thresholds, excludes, owners, boundaries and enable flags are architecture
decisions: changing any of them requires a separate full audit and review
before the change is committed. `--staged` refuses with exit code 2 while a
policy change is staged, but the gate does not record whether the audit ran, so
the audit and review are the committer's obligation. Disabling a checker or
raising a limit is never remediation. The
full option list, defaults, types and examples for each checker are on the page
linked from the [checker index](references/checkers.md).
